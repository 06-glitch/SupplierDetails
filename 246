give powerscript in powerbuilder for the following - NEED TO ADD NULL ==  accounting_control_code = 3 or 5 or NULL

We need to create an error message within eMES when a mfg order has any sku that has a GGSM SEG COND = D and an accounting_control_code = 3 or 5.

To many times, analyst are creating material that is not active in GGSM and that causes broker errors and holds up mfg orders from being costed.  This type of function will NOT work in SAP.

This error message needs to be applied when:

Production is adding an output sku to a mfg order.

Analyst is adding an output to a BOM.

When creating a mfg order and a sku has a seg code of D.

When changing a mfg order from Firmed to Scheduled.

When changing a mfg order from Scheduled to Active.

When creating a BOM.

When adding a BOM output.

When adding a BOM component.

When inserting a demand order, which then creates a mfg
