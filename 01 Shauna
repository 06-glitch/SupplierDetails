Thanks for pointing this out. After checking my usage and query history, it looks like my UPIN/NPSA (A26CLZZ) is currently mapped to the default warehouse (WH), which is why everything is running against AN_WW02_DAA_P. That explains the higher monthly cost and why it’s charging the wrong Supply Chain cost center.

I wasn’t aware that my ID should be using WH_M instead. If WH_M is the correct warehouse for my group, I’m happy to switch to it — I just need to know which warehouse my UPIN should be mapped to so it can be updated properly.

Thanks again for catching this.
