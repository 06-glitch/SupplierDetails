Got it 👍 — I’ll make each one more **specific** and action-driven, tying it to IT support and your PowerBuilder/IT admin/security request type of work:

1. **Implemented the “Journey to Zero” initiative by reinforcing IT safety protocols and ensuring compliance across support processes.**
2. **Collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline workflows, eliminating duplicate password resets and redundant support tasks.**
3. **Consolidated site-specific application queues into a unified support structure, reducing ticket resolution time.**
4. **Standardized and automated security request handling for IMES and PMCSNT, improving turnaround and reducing errors.**
5. **Developed automation for USAC application metrics, ensuring data accuracy and alignment with enterprise architecture standards.**
6. **Enhanced end-user experience by simplifying the incident submission process, reducing manual steps and errors.**

👉 Do you want me to align these more towards a **performance review summary** (showing impact/results) or **resume bullets** (showing achievements for your CV)?
