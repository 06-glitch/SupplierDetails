Thanks for sharing the screenshot — that helps clarify the issue.

From Gary’s note, it looks like the **`d_oi_bom_loads_allocated` datawindow** has the **“Allow Updates”** option disabled, which means loads can’t be deallocated anymore. This seems to be a direct result of the recent changes.

Here’s a refined email draft you can send to Matt that includes this specific detail without pointing fingers:

**Subject:** Issue in Production – Load Deallocation Not Working

Hi Matt,

I wanted to bring to your attention an issue we are seeing in production. The `d_oi_bom_loads_allocated` datawindow is no longer allowing updates, which is preventing loads from being deallocated.

This behavior started after the latest set of changes was moved from dev to production. Since the person who worked on those updates is currently out, I thought it best to flag this so we can align on the next steps.

Could you advise on how you’d like us to proceed? Specifically, whether we should:

* Investigate and re-enable updates on the datawindow,
* Consider a rollback if necessary, or
* Handle this through the appropriate change process with paperwork/records.

I’ll continue gathering more details, but I wanted to loop you in quickly, especially in Jesse’s absence.

Thanks,
\[Your Name]

Would you like me to also draft a **short Teams/Slack message** version of this that you can quickly drop to Matt before sending the formal email?
