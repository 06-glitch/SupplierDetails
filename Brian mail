**Subject:** RE: Emergency Change Request on Friday

Hi Cheryl,

I wanted to provide additional context regarding the issue we encountered. One of our developers made an update to the SQL table as part of the eMES Hutchinson code update that our team was implementing. This particular change inadvertently caused one of the data windows to reset some of its configurations to default values.

As a result, the data window needed to be manually updated to reflect the correct values. The resolution itself was straightforward, but identifying the root cause took additional time because the developer responsible for the update was on vacation. This led to a delay in fully addressing the issue until Friday.

To prevent a recurrence of this type of problem, we have updated our developer documentation and added more detailed notes on how changes to SQL tables can impact downstream configurations. Our goal is to ensure that future updates are both clearly tracked and better supported, even if the original developer is unavailable.

Please let me know if you would like us to review these documentation updates with your team or implement any additional safeguards.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]

Would you like me to also make this **more formal and risk-focused** (e.g., mentioning impact mitigation and governance), or keep it **collaborative and solution-focused** as I drafted here?
